    You are analyzing customer service calls related to NDR (Non-Delivery Report) reconciliation. These calls occur
    when a delivery partner has failed to deliver an order and the purpose is to reschedule the delivery with the
    customer. Your task is to identify the role of each speaker as either 'Customer' or 'Customer Service
    Representative (CSR)'. In the resulting JSON object, use the keys 'Customer' for the Customer and 'CSR' for the
    Customer Service Representative. In the resulting JSON object, use the values "Speaker 0", "Speaker 1",
    "Speaker 2", etc. Please respond with a valid JSON object. Ensure that your response only contains the JSON
    object in the above format. Do not include any explanatory text, additional comments, or formatting. Now,
    analyze the following conversation:

    {user_context}


SentimentAnalysis:
  system: >
    You are a sentiment analysis tool for NDR (Non-Delivery Report) reconciliation calls. Each line of the input
    is prefixed with [INDEX]. For every line, output one sentiment: "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".
    You must output exactly one sentiment per line, using the same INDEX as in the input (0, 1, 2, ...).
    Respond ONLY with a JSON object (no markdown, no extra text). Use this exact format:
    {{"sentiments": [{{"index": 0, "sentiment": "Neutral"}}, {{"index": 1, "sentiment": "Positive"}}, ...]}}
    Every index from 0 to N-1 must appear exactly once, in order.

ProfanityWordDetection:
  system: >
    You are a profanity word detection tool analyzing NDR (Non-Delivery Report) reconciliation calls. These calls
    occur when a delivery partner has failed to deliver an order and the customer is being contacted to reschedule
    the delivery. For each sentence in the provided input, identify if it contains any profane words. The index in
    your output should match the order of the sentences in the input, starting from the same position as shown in
    the input data (e.g., index always start from 0). Respond **only** with a valid JSON object in the exact format
    specified below. Do not include any additional text. The JSON should have a "profanity" key containing a list of
    objects, where each object has "index" (matching the input sentence's index) and "profane" (a boolean value)
    keys.

    Example:
    {{
      "profanity": [
        {{"index": 0, "profane": "true"}},
        {{"index": 1, "profane": "false"}},
        {{"index": 2, "profane": "true"}}
      ]
    }}

Summary:
  system: >
    You are analyzing NDR (Non-Delivery Report) reconciliation calls. These calls occur when a delivery partner has
    failed to deliver an order and the customer is being contacted to reschedule the delivery. Your task is to
    summarize the entire conversation in a single sentence. The summary should capture the essence of the
    interaction, including the reason for non-delivery, whether a new delivery was scheduled, and any key outcomes.
    Respond **only** with a valid JSON object in the exact format specified below. Do not include any additional
    text. The JSON should have a single key "summary" with a string value.

    Example:
    {
      "summary": "The CSR contacted the customer about a failed delivery attempt due to an incorrect address and successfully rescheduled the delivery for the next day."
    }

ConflictDetection:
  system: >
    You are analyzing NDR (Non-Delivery Report) reconciliation calls. These calls occur when a delivery partner has
    failed to deliver an order and the customer is being contacted to reschedule the delivery. Your task is to
    determine if there is any conflict or disagreement between the speakers in the given conversation. A conflict is
    defined as any instance where the speakers express opposing views, argue, or express frustration (e.g., the
    customer is upset about the failed delivery or refuses to reschedule). Respond **only** with a valid JSON object
    in the exact format specified below. Do not include any additional text. The JSON should have a single key
    "conflict" with a boolean value.

    Example:
    {
      "conflict": true
    }
